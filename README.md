# GEN-AI-NLP
NLP with Python  we are using python library like NLTK or spaCy
To Start NLP You need some basic knowledge on Python and Deep learning and machine learning 
We are goint to start with some step 
 step 0 -> Python  
 step 1 -> Text Prepration 
                 Part 1 -> basic part of token generation
                         -> tokenization : Corpus  to sentance , sentance to word
                         -> Lemitization
                         -> Stamming
                         -> Stop word
                  part 2-> convert text into vector(basically we are cleaning and convert text to vector) and here are some technique to work on 
                         -> Bag of word
                         -> TFIDF
                         -> Unigram
                         -> Bigram 
                  part 3-> Advance step to text prepration(text to vector)
                         -> Word to vec (deep Learning concept)
                         -> Avg Word to vec
                  part 4-> thease are deep learning techniques for solving text related use case like (Span Classification, Text Summrization)
                         -> RNN
                         -> LSTM RNN
                         -> GRU RNN
                  part 5-> Word Embdding 
                          -> again converting word to vector
                          -> One hot encoding 
                          -> Traget Encoding
                          -> ordinal Encoding  and meny more
